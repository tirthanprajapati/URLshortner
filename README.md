# URL Shortener with User Management and Analytics

A URL shortener application with added features for user management, URL expiration, and click analytics.

### New Features

1. **User Authentication for Personal Link Management**:
   - Users can register, log in, and manage their shortened URLs.
   - Each URL is linked to a specific user, providing personal link management.

2. **URL Expiration**:
   - URLs can be set to expire after a certain period.
   - Expired URLs automatically become inaccessible and display an error if accessed.

3. **Click Analytics**:
   - The application tracks the number of clicks on each shortened URL.
   - Users can view the click count in their dashboard for insights.


## Installation

After cloning and setting up the backend and frontend, configure user authentication by adding `authConfig.js` in the `config` folder of the backend:

```plaintext
SECRET_KEY=<your_secret_key>
```
